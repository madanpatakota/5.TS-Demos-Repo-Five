1. What is typescript ?
   TypeScript extends JavaScript and improves the developer experience.
   TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
   TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add types


2.Why we have to use the typescript?

  In Javascript It's very difficult to understand what types of data we are passing to the variable.
  I mean In JavaScript function parameters and variables don't have any information in code declaration.


  So Here in typescript:
  TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to generate the errors when the types don't match.

  Note : Here types means datatypes
